# Zooniverse workshop

## Introduction

Koen Hufkens was lead on 2 citizen science projects
- Jungle Rhythms
- Jungle Weather

Both within the context of historical data recovery

- Involved in two more as collaborator

----
## Context

- Brief historical overview
- What makes a good citizen science project
- What are the costs involved
	- outsourcing some of this work isn't free
- How to implement this
	- various online platforms
		- DoeDat
		- Zooniverse
		- CVAT (ML annnotation)
	- Best practices 
- Questions on the above ...
- Demonstration of creating a Zooniverse project 

----
## What is Citizen Science

Historically, seen as mostly an outreach activity, where citizens were involved to a limited extent into small scientific tasks to raise awareness and understanding.

Currently, due to crowd-sourcing platforms, contributions have grown from outreach to actionable data.

Although quality control must be in place, the data produced is used in research, rather than considered for demonstration purposes only.

----
## Shift in mindset

This shift in mindset has not been fully established or accepted in many branches of research.

This presents a missed opportunity, mostly due to a lack of understanding of the process of running a robust crowdsourcing campaign.

## Examples

(provide images)

- Galaxy zoo
- Animal recognition
- Difficult transcriptions

- Often supporting the training of or validation of automated tasks
- Often cover only a fraction of all the data (more on this later)

## What makes a good citizen science project

### Public engagement

Tasks should make a true contribution to science. As mentioned, it should extend beyond basic outreach (these days).

Engagement is required. The conversation, contact, between scientists and the public is often key to the success of projects (on Zooniverse). Interactions via blog posts, forums and other means (twitter), are therefore key.

In this respect, citizen science is not "free labour". It is a way to tap into large crowds and use people's generousity and curiousity to the benefit of science (rather than say infinitely scrolling past ads on social media). BUT, engaging the public is required, and obviously takes time (more on timing - costs later).

Key in this whole is therefore also the story that you tell, what is the motivation for the task. Why is it needed and critical. What is the backstory, also from a personal perspective as a researcher (why are you passionate about this project).

### Gamification & fun factor

The most successful projects have a high gamification or wow factor to them. 

- They are challenging but at the same time do not take too long to solve (from a puzzle perspective).
- Or they present surprises and or pretty pictures (fuzzy animals and pretty pictures always perform well)
- They have a strong lead story to them if the above are not present

### Guidelines

- Tasks remain simple
- Ideally do not take more than 20s
- Can be done on a tablet / cellphone (ideally)

----

## Considerations

- internal vs external campaigns
	- external campaign requires more engagement
	- strong story
	- qa/qc statistics and more replication
- public platforms or internal software CVAT
	- leveraging Zooniverse internally can be quick
		- convenient platform (by all standards)
	- CVAT (dedicated software) is often more flexible
		- dedicated export formats
		- has user management + task assignment
		- relatively easy to setup (docker)
		- iterative labelling (using models to label using previous labels)
