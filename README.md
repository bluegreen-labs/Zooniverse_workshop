# Zooniverse workshop

## Introduction

Zooniverse is an online platform for creating citizen science projects. The
platform allows you to engage with citizens to crowd source data collection.

In a world which relies more and more on machine learning the creation of 
annotated datasets is a key research tasks. Here we share experiences with the
Zooniverse platform, as gained through running two highly successful crowd
sourcing projects Jungle Rhythms and Jungle Weather.

The workshop will focus on a brief history of Citizen Science, the best
practices and general considerations when considering a citizen science project,
a hands on demonstration creating your own little annotation project on
Zooniverse, and finally a few notes on automation / scoping and the iterative
design of citizen science projects.
